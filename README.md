## Installation

### To run our Backend (Django) Project Locally 

Run the backend application before running any frontend application. All migrations have been applied and database has been populated. Follow these steps to run a Django project on your local machine:

1. Clone the project repository: 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/talkshrey/imobilothon
```
2. Navigate to the branch: `backend`
3. Create a virtual environment and pip install the requirements.txt file
4. Navigate to the project directory: `cd carconnect`
5. Simply run the server: `python manage.py runserver`
6. You can login to the admin panel using these credentials: (Username - admin@gmail.com, Password - admin)
7. You can also view the API documentation in the `/swagger` route

### To run our React Project Locally 

Follow these steps to run a React project on your local machine:

1. Clone the project repository: 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/talkshrey/imobilothon
```
2. Navigate to the branch: `frontend`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd car-connect`
3. Install project dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start the development server: `npm start`
5. Open your web browser and visit: `http://localhost:3000/login`
6. Login with the following credentials: (Username - user1@gmail.com, Password - testpass@123)
7. Once logged in you can go to the home page (main car screen)

You should now see the React project running in your browser. 

### To run our React Native Project Locally

Follow these steps to run a React Native project on your local machine:

1. Clone the project repository: `
```bash
git clone https://github.com/talkshrey/imobilothon
```
2. Navigate to the branch:  `app`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd Car-Connect-App`
3. Install project dependencies: `npm install`
4. Make sure you have set up the development environment by installing Node.js and React Native CLI.
5. Connect your Android or iOS device to your computer, or set up an emulator/simulator.
6. Start the development server: `npx react-native start`
7. In a new terminal window, run the project on the connected device or emulator:
   - For Android: `npx react-native run-android`
   - For iOS: `npx react-native run-ios`

The React Native project should now start building and running on your device or emulator. You will see the app running and any changes made to the code will automatically update in real-time.
